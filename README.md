### CuraEngine Definition Parsing with a more Object-Oriented Approach
### *Purpose*
> The purpose of this library is to approach the parsing of CuraEngine printer definitions in a more object-oriented way. There is the brute-force way of iterating over all the keys of the overrides section of a Cura printer def.json file. However in the long-term, that does not seem very sustainable (especially if the CuraEngine backend becomes more and more complicated). This project contain my initial efforts to go about parsing a Cura def.json file in a more systematic, modular way.
